# Odd_or_Even
 
<p>Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.</p>

<p>Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.</p>
<p> e.g. 86 is even because 86 ÷ 2 = 43 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.</p>
<p> e.g. 59 is odd because 59 ÷ 2 = 29.5</p>
<p>29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.</p>

<p>The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.</p>
<p>e.g. 6 ÷ 2 = 3 with no remainder. therefore: 6 % 2 = 0 </p>

<p>5 ÷ 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1. therefore: 5 % 2 = 1</p>
<p>14 ÷ 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2. therefore: 14 % 4 = 2</p>
<p>Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops</p>

<p>Example Input 1: 43</p>
<p>Example Output 1: This is an odd number.</p>

<p>Example Input 2: 94</p>
<p>Example Output 2: This is an even number.</p>
